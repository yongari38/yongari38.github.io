I am a passionate and enthusiactic person, I work well both as a team and on my own. I love to engage technical audiences to influence them with my research. I express empathy to Microsoft’s slogan, *“to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more”*, since I belive the essence of engineering is to enfluence everyday lives of various people.<br>
<br>
I am currently in my final year of B.S. in Computer Science and Engineering at Korea University. I have been working as a research intern at Information System Security Lab since 2019. My research interests include system security, microarchitectural attacks, side-channel attacks, and safe AI.
